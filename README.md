# ML-Disease_Detection

## Accuracy of Various Models for Heart Disease Detection:
The aim of this project is to predict whether a patient has a high risk of having a heart disease or not. This problem is a classification problem as the outputs for "Heart Attack Risk" as either:

0 = the patient is not at risk
1 = the patient is at risk
In this project we will use different methods to make our predictions, which means we will train different models and compare their performances. I try to keep this notebook as simple as possible, as the goal of this project is not to do some overlly verbose EDA. However a deeper dive into preprocessing and feature engineering might help to imporve the accuracy.
